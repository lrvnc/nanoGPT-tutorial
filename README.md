# nanoGPT
Welcome to my reproduction of the code from the video ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) by Andrej Karpathy. This repository contains my personal notes and in-depth comments, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the content.

My primary intention is to create a resource that's as useful for others as it has been for me in unraveling the complexities of Transformers. This fascinating technology is currently revolutionizing the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I hope you find this repository beneficial in your journey of learning and understanding the intricacies of Transformers. Happy learning!
